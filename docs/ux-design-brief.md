# MASTER UX/UI DESIGN PROMPT
## Premium Charitable Trust & Donation Website

### 1. Project Overview

Design a premium, modern, responsive charitable trust website focused on multiple social welfare activities and online donations.

The website must establish trust, communicate social impact, present ongoing welfare activities, and provide a transparent and convenient donation experience.

The platform must serve two primary audiences:

1. Public visitors and individual donors.
2. Trust administrators responsible for managing donations, activities, projects, receipts, and financial information.

The public website should feel premium, elegant, trustworthy, human-centred, and institutionally credible.

### 2. Brand Identity

**Selected colour palette: Midnight Navy**

| Colour | HEX | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Midnight Navy | #172B46 | Primary brand |
| Champagne Gold | #C6A76B | Accent |
| Silver Mist | #E5E7E9 | Secondary background |
| Cloud White | #F7F8FA | Main background |
| Steel Blue | #34465B | Secondary elements |
| Graphite | #262D35 | Primary typography |

Additional semantic colours:
- Success: #287A55
- Warning: #B7791F
- Error: #B42318
- Information: #3568A8

Use champagne gold sparingly. It should highlight important elements rather than dominate the interface.

### 3. Selected Design Language

Combine three complementary design approaches:

**A. Classy Minimalism**
- Spacious layouts.
- Restrained decorative elements.
- Strong typography hierarchy.
- Minimal borders and subtle shadows.
- Clear navigation.
- Consistent visual rhythm.

**B. Editorial Design**
- Large, sophisticated serif headings.
- Authentic social welfare photography.
- Storytelling-focused layouts.
- Asymmetrical image and text compositions.
- Large impact statements.
- Magazine-inspired content presentation.

**C. Modern Bento Grid**
- Modular card layouts.
- Different card dimensions.
- Structured social welfare categories.
- Impact statistics.
- Project highlights.
- Responsive grid arrangements.

Avoid excessive glassmorphism, neumorphism, gradients, animations, decorative illustrations, and generic SaaS dashboard aesthetics.

### 4. Typography System

English:
- Headings: Libre Baskerville.
- Body: Inter.
- Statistics: Inter.

Tamil:
- Noto Sans Tamil.

> **Update 31 Oct 2026 (#46, ADR 0003):** Tamil **headings** use **Noto Serif Tamil** (700); Tamil
> body text and buttons use Noto Sans Tamil. Legacy non-Unicode fonts such as Bamini are not used.

Typography hierarchy:

| Element | Desktop | Mobile |
|---|---:|---:|
| Hero heading | 64px | 38px |
| H1 | 48px | 34px |
| H2 | 38px | 28px |
| H3 | 26px | 22px |
| Body | 17px | 16px |
| Small text | 14px | 13px |

Use appropriate line heights and avoid excessively thin font weights.

### 16. Execution Instructions

Work in the following order:

Phase 1: Brand identity and design tokens.

Phase 2: Sitemap and user journeys.

Phase 3: Homepage wireframes.

Phase 4: Donation workflow wireframes.

Phase 5: High-fidelity desktop and mobile UI.

Phase 6: Interactive prototype.

Use realistic sample content only for demonstration. Clearly identify placeholder trust details, statistics, projects, and photographs.

The goal is to create a distinctive, premium, transparent and donor-friendly charitable trust digital experience.
