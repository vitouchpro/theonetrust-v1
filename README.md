## Requirements

Node 22 (`.nvmrc`) and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`).

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # fill locally; never commit
pnpm exec playwright install chromium --with-deps   # once, for e2e (run inside apps/web)
pnpm dev                      # web http://localhost:5173 · API http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health
```

## Quality gate

```bash
pnpm verify:quick   # format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, tests-required gate
pnpm verify         # + coverage thresholds, build, Playwright on 5 viewports with the auto bug detector
```

CI runs the same gate on every pull request. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
